Project Title : Traffic violations and bus ridership in Chicago before and during the pandemic

Team Members : Walter, Jacqueline, Victoria

Project Description : Comparing traffic data in Chicago with respect to bus ridership, red light camera violations, and speeding violations.

Research Questions to Answer : What was the relationship of camera violations in 2020 compared to 2019? Will we see a decrease in bus riders because of Covid?
What is the relationship between violations and bus ridership?

Datasets to be Used : https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Red-Light-Camera-Violations/spqx-js37, https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4, https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-Bus-Routes-Daily-Totals-by-Route/jyb9-n7fm

Rough Breakdown of Task : Each group member takes an assigned data set and analyze the violations or ridership in 2019 and 2020.

When talking about the conclusions from our data, we can obviously see the dramatic decrease in bus ridership from 2019 to 2020, especially after March of 2020.  We can see that red light camera violations went up from 2019 to 2020 and speeding violations stayed about the same.  We think that this could be due to the amount of people that used to ride the bus to work or other destinations now drive, and are not as familiar with the camera traps that are set up all over the city.

After hearing feedback in class that we could have added the below data set, which initially we tried to but it was too large for our computers to download, we decided to add here to possibly analyze at a further time.
